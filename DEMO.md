# Demo Instructions for SpeechToText-Prototype7

## Phase 1 Implementation Complete! 🎉

The prototype is now ready for testing. Here's what has been implemented:

### ✅ Completed Features

1. **Audio Capture System**
   - Browser microphone access with permission handling
   - Real-time audio recording using MediaRecorder API
   - Audio level monitoring and visual feedback
   - Pause/Resume functionality
   - Error handling for device issues

2. **fal.ai Wizper API Integration**
   - Complete API client with authentication
   - Audio blob processing and base64 encoding
   - Chunked audio processing for near real-time results
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - Request timeout and abort handling

3. **React Components & UI**
   - Clean, responsive design with Tailwind CSS
   - Audio controls with recording status
   - Real-time transcript display with confidence scores
   - Segment-based transcript with timestamps
   - Copy functionality for individual segments or full transcript

4. **TypeScript Integration**
   - Complete type definitions for audio and transcript data
   - Strongly typed React hooks and components
   - Service layer with proper error typing

### 🚀 How to Test

1. **Start the Application**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
2. **Open Browser**
   - Go to http://localhost:3000
   - Grant microphone permissions when prompted

3. **Configure API Key**
   - Click "Configure API Key" button
   - Enter your fal.ai API key (get one from https://fal.ai/)

4. **Test Recording**
   - Click "Start Recording"
   - Speak clearly into your microphone
   - Watch the real-time transcript appear
   - Use Pause/Resume as needed
   - Click "Stop" to finish

### 🧪 Testing Scenarios

Try these scenarios to verify functionality:

**Basic Recording:**
- Record a simple sentence: "Hello, this is a test of the speech recognition system."
- Verify transcript appears with confidence scores

**Long Recording:**
- Record for 30+ seconds to test chunked processing
- Verify multiple segments appear in real-time

**Audio Quality:**
- Test in quiet environment vs. background noise
- Check confidence scores vary appropriately

**Error Handling:**
- Test without API key configured
- Test with invalid API key
- Test microphone permission denial

### 📊 What to Observe

1. **Latency**: Time from speech to transcript display
2. **Accuracy**: How well it transcribes your speech
3. **Confidence Scores**: Visual indicators for transcript quality
4. **UI Responsiveness**: Smooth interaction during recording
5. **Error Handling**: Clear error messages and recovery

### 🔧 Key Files

- **Main App**: `src/App.tsx` - Main application logic
- **Audio Capture**: `src/services/audioCapture.ts` - Core recording functionality
- **Wizper API**: `src/services/wizperAPI.ts` - fal.ai integration
- **Hooks**: `src/hooks/` - React state management
- **Components**: `src/components/` - UI components

### 📈 Next Steps for Phase 2

After testing Phase 1, we can implement:
- Audio visualization with waveforms
- Voice Activity Detection (VAD)
- Speaker diarization
- Performance optimization
- Enhanced error recovery

### 🐛 Known Limitations

- Requires HTTPS in production for microphone access
- API rate limits may affect continuous recording
- Processing time depends on network speed
- Browser compatibility varies for audio formats
